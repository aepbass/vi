to update the project:

add all changes:
git add .


add to the next commit:
git add filename.extension


commit changes:
git commit -m "something like 'third commit'"


push to git account:
git push origin master


git bash uses a lot of bash commands. This is something that is common in linux.
Some cheats:

..                 moves up a directory
cd ~/directory     moves to a directory
cd ~/directory/..  moves a level up from directory
mkdir		   makes a folder in the current directory you're in

If you want to get good at this stuff, download linux (try wubi) and play around.















When you get done with your changes, add your files to the next commit and then commit it to the account.

an example of saving all your work online:

cd ~/vi
git add .
git commit -m "fourth commit"
git push origin master
